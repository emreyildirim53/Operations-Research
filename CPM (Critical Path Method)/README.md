# Critical Path Method (CPM)

The critical path method (CPM) is a step-by-step project management technique for process planning that defines critical and non-critical tasks with the goal of preventing time-frame problems and process bottlenecks. The CPM is ideally suited to projects consisting of numerous activities that interact in a complex manner.
##### In applying the CPM, there are several steps that can be summarized as follows:
  - Define the required tasks and put them down in an ordered (sequenced) list.
  - Create a flowchart or other diagram showing each task in relation to the others.
  - Identify the critical and non-critical relationships (paths) among tasks.
  - Determine the expected completion or execution time for each task.
  - Locate or devise alternatives (backups) for the most critical paths.
